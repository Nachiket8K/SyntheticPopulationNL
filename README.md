# SyntheticPopulationNL
This repository aims to create a synthetic population for the country of the Netherlands based on the open source data available from the Central Bureau of Statistics of Netherlands.  The initial prototype of the model will focus only on the city of The Hague and create a resolution on the 4 level postcode of neighbourhoods.


The order of execution for these notebooks is as follows: 

1) Age_Assignment.ipynb
2) Gender_Assignment.ipynb

Newer notebooks will be added as more data is added and the complexity of the agents will increase proportionally.
